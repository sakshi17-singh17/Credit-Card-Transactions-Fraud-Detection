# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate credit card fraud detection system using advanced machine learning techniques. Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge to financial institutions and consumers alike. This project aims to implement an intelligent solution that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions, providing an added layer of security to financial systems.

### Scope:
The project will utilize a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing anonymized credit card transactions labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. The scope encompasses the entire data science pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

### Methodology:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
* Understand the dataset structure, including features and labels.
* Address any missing values and assess the distribution of classes.
* Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

2.Feature Engineering:
* Extract meaningful features from the transaction data.
* Explore the creation of new features that could enhance the model's ability to detect fraud.
* Investigate time-based features, transaction patterns, and customer behavior.

3. Model Development:
* Implement advanced machine learning algorithms suitable for fraud detection, such as ensemble methods or deep learning architectures.
* Consider techniques like anomaly detection and oversampling to handle class imbalance.
* Train and fine-tune models using appropriate evaluation metrics to optimize performance.

4. Evaluation and Validation:
* Assess the models' performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.
* Utilize cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness across different subsets of the data.
* Investigate the model's sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and potential overfitting.
